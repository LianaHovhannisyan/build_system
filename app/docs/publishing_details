2. Description

This is a SIM Card monitoring application. It will send SMS messages to
the predefined phone number when the SIM card is replaced in your mobile phone.
ATTENTION: The application will work only on GSM phones with SIM cards. 

In this new release the application icon is hidden in the applications list: 
after filling the required information on the setup screen the icon of the 
application  will disappear from your menu. 

The application could be called back for reconfiguraion by dialing specified number. 

After the setup, in the case that SIM card change is detected, the SMS will be sent 
to the specified phone number each time the phone reboots.  

If accessible, the current GPS coordinates will also be included in the SMS.
NOTE: depending on device settings, GPS availability, and GSM provider settings these 
may not be available.

The active sim serial number can be registered by sending SMS with custom 
content from specified phone number.

In case, if the admin rights permission is granted to the application, the device can be remotly 
blocked by setting custom password.

Please report bugs to authors with more details. We were unable to reproduce the issue
reported by some users about SMS being sent even when the SIM card is not changed.  Please
specify sequence of steps you did, and if possible, specify your carrier.
